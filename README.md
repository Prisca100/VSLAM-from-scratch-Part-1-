# Visual Slam from scratch (Part 1: Visual Odometry)

Building off of my final year project, I decided to take on building an entire Visual SLAM algorithm. This project explores all the building blocks of the algorithm in great detail. Huge thanks to this [article](https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/visual-slam/) for the detailed explanation on the 6 core concepts of Visual SLAM. Hopefully this projects help others gain deeper insights by understanding the math and the programming behind the algorithm.

The following Visual SLAM algorithm is carried out in these steps.
1. Visual Odometry & Local Mapping
2. Global Mapping and Optimization.

In this part, we will focus on the first steps and explore the next step in a later part.
